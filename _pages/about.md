👨🏻‍💻 I'm a Risk Modelling Expert in Benelux region


🔬 I'm interested in bridging the gap between Data Science and Risk Modelling. I am passionate about leveraging the power of Machine Learning and Computational Science to solve and optimize complex problems in Risk Management.


👨🏻‍🔬 Welcome! Please visit the "Blog Posts" tab to explore my articles about my "Weekly Dose of Data Science". I'm passionate about sharing knowledge because I believe it's a powerful way to learn from others.
