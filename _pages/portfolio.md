Born and raised in Vietnam, I left for the US at age of 16 to attend high school in Watertown,NY. I've always loved figuring things out and working with numbers, so majoring in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at the University of Arizona was a no-brainer. Four amazing years in the Arizona desert later, thanks to a little political chaos (Brexit and Trump's policies), I found myself across the pond in Dublin, studying data science and statistics at University College Dublin.<br>
<br>
Currently, I'm based in Amsterdam. I've been fortunate enough to live in 3 continents and 4 different countries: Vietnam, the US (New York and Arizona), Ireland, and the Netherlands.<br>
<br>
Besides work, I'm a big football fan (die-hard Manchester United supporter!), enjoy a cold Belgian blonde beers, and love collecting watches.<br>
