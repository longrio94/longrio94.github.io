Hey there! I grew up in Vietnam and graduated high school with honors in Watertown, NY. I've always loved numbers and problem-solving, so it was a natural fit for me to head to the University of Arizona for a degree in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research. Four amazing years in the Arizona desert later, thanks to a little political chaos (Brexit and Trump's policies), I found myself across the pond in Dublin, studying data science and statistics at University College Dublin.<br>
<br>
Currently, I'm based in Amsterdam. I've been fortunate enough to live in 3 continents and 4 different countries: Vietnam, the US (New York and Arizona), Ireland, and the Netherlands.<br>
<br>
Besides work, I'm a big football fan (die-hard Manchester United supporter!), enjoy a cold Belgian blonde beer, and love collecting watches.<br>
