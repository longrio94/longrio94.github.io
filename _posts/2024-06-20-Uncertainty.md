Uncertainty Quantification: From Point to Interval
======

Uncertainty is a crucial factor in decision-making that needs more attention when using machine learning models. In machine learning, where uncertainty is inherent and can significantly impact decision-making, Quantile Regression (QR), Conformal Prediction (CP), and Conformalized Quantile Regression (CQR) offer valuable tools to enhance model reliability and interpretability. These techniques help machine learning models evolve from providing point estimates to delivering interval estimates that capture and quantify uncertainty, thereby supporting more robust decision-making processes.

Let's explain conformal prediction in simple terms, using a real-life example that might remind you of your favorite childhood game show in Vietnam, "Hãy chọn giá đúng" (Choose the Correct Price). Remember how you had to guess the exact price of a product to win? It was a fun challenge, but wouldn't it be easier to give a price range instead? If you guessed 100,000 VND but the actual price was 102,500 VND, you'd lose. However, if you could say the price was between 100,000 VND and 105,000 VND, you'd be much more likely to win!


The model, just like us, prefers to give a range of predicted values rather than a single, absolute value. This is where the benefit of prediction intervals comes into play for decision-making. In essence, moving from point estimates to interval estimates can provide a more informative and reliable prediction.
